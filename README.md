# Syngas Operating Parameter Analysis - Temperature and Conversion Profiles
##### This user-friendly app is aimed at analysing the effects of operating parameters such as Methane and Steam flowrates, Temperature, Pressure etc of a Syngas Process.

##### Results were compared to MATLAB and Hand Calculations; There were no variations in answers.
